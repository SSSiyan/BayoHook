# BayoHook
A trainer for the Steam version of Bayonetta made using [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook), [DX9 BaseHook](https://github.com/rdbo/DX9-BaseHook) and [dmc4_hook](https://github.com/muhopensores/dmc4_hook).

This dll will give you access to training, gameplay, and quality of life options without ever needing to open anything alongside your exe.

Builds are intended for use on the Steam version of the game and will crash on other versions.

Please back up your save before using this hook. Savedata can be found in `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\[steamid]\460790\remote`.
